\q1 Refuge and Bodhicitta
\q
\b
\v 1 In the Buddha, the Dharma and the Supreme Assembly,
\q1 I take refuge until I attain enlightenment.
\q1 Through the merit of practising generosity and so on,
\q1 May I attain buddhahood for the benefit of beings!
\q
\b
\b1 Repeat this verse three times
\q1 The four immeasurables.
\q
\b
\v 2 May all sentient beings enjoy happiness and the causes of happiness!
\q1 May they be free from suffering and the causes of suffering!
\q1 May they never be separated from the sacred happiness devoid of suffering!
\q1 And may they dwell in boundless equanimity that is free from attachment and aversion!
\b
\s Recalling the Qualities of the Three Jewels
\q
\b
\v 13 Homage to the omniscient one! Thus the Buddha, the transcendent, accomplished conqueror, the tathāgata who has attained suchness, the arhat who has conquered all foes, is a perfectly and completely enlightened buddha, endowed with insight and worthy of reverence, The sugata who has reached the state of bliss, The knower of the entire world, The guide and tamer of beings, The unsurpassable one, The teacher of gods and humans, The Buddha Bhagavat.
\q
\b
\v 14 The tathāgata is in harmony with all merit. He does not waste the sources of virtue. He is fully adorned with patience. He is the foundation of the treasures of merit. He is ornamented with the excellent minor marks.
\q
\b
\v 15 He is the full blossoming of the major marks. His activity is timely and fitting. Seeing him, there is nothing displeasing. He brings true joy to those who have faith. His insight overwhelms all in its splendour. His powers are invincible.
\q
\b
\v 16 He is the teacher of all sentient beings. He is the father of all bodhisattvas. He is the sovereign of all the noble ones. He is the guide who leads beings to the city of nirvāṇa.
\q
\b
\v 17 He has measureless wisdom. He possesses inconceivable fearlessness. His speech is utterly pure. Its tones are melodious. One can never have enough of looking at him. His form is without comparison.
\q
\b
\v 18 He is unsullied by the realm of desire. He is quite unsullied by the realm of form. He is not caught up in the formless realm. He is completely liberated from suffering.
\q
\b
\v 19 He is totally liberated from the aggregates. He is not possessed with the constituents of ordinary experience. He is in control of the sense fields.
\q
\b
\v 20 He has cut right through the knots. He is completely liberated from torment. He is freed from craving. He has crossed over the river. He is perfected in all the wisdoms.
\q
\b
\v 21 He abides in the wisdom of all the buddhas of past, present and future. He does not dwell in nirvāṇa. He abides in perfect finality.
\q
\b
\v 22 He remains on the level where he sees all sentient beings. All these are the authentic and supreme qualities of the embodiment of the Buddha.
\q
\b
\v 23 The sacred Dharma is good at the beginning, good in the middle and good at the end. It is excellent in meaning, Excellent in words and syllables. It is distinctive. It is totally complete. It is utterly pure. It completely purifies.
\q
\b
\v 24 "The Buddha teaches the Dharma perfectly. It brings unerring vision. It is without affliction. It is constant and always timely. It is trustworthy when applied. Seeing it fulfils one’s purpose. The wise can validate it through their own awareness. The Dharma taught by the buddha relies entirely on training the mind. It is truly delivering. It causes one to arrive at perfect enlightenment. It is without contradiction. It is all-embracing. It is constant. It is the cessation of all uncertainty."
\q
\b
\v 25 As for the Saṅgha of the Great vehicle, they enter thoroughly. They enter with awareness. They enter straightforwardly. They enter harmoniously. They are worthy of veneration with palms joined together. They are worthy of receiving prostrations. They are a glorious field of merit. Offering to them brings great purification. They are an object of generosity. They are in every way the greatest object of generosity.

\q1 And caused the Buddha’s teachings to flourish within the Land of Snows—

\q
\b
\v 44 Through these prayers of mine, made with a mind of vivid and unshakeable faith,
\q1 To these most brilliant of scholars, who, like ornaments, enhanced and beautified the world,
\q1 And were the supreme sources for so many wondrous and excellent teachings,
\q1 May my mind be blessed so that it is matured and brought to liberation!
\q
\b
\v 45 May I be blessed so that I plant the foundation for the path to freedom:
\q1 May I understand the fundamental nature of reality and the meaning of the two truths,
\q1 Gain certainty about the four truths and how saṃsāra is perpetuated or discontinued,
\q1 And, through valid cognition, develop stable and lasting faith in the Three Jewels.
\q
\b
\v 46 May I be blessed so that I come to master uncontrived bodhichitta,
\q1 Together with its roots: a mind of renunciation seeking the goal of perfect liberation,
\q1 In which all forms of suffering and their causes are thoroughly pacified,
\q1 And a compassionate wish to protect all beings, as limitless as space itself.

\v 47 May I be blessed so that I arrive easily at a definitive understanding
\q1 Of all the profound points of the paths of the transcendent perfection vehicle
\q1 And the vajrayāna, through studying, reflecting and meditating
\q1 Upon the meaning of the great pioneering masters’ classic works.
\q
\b
\v 48 In life after life, may I always find the perfect situation and take up the threefold training,
\q1 May I work for the good of the teachings, just like the great pioneering masters of old,
\q1 And, through teaching as well as through practice,
\q1 May I maintain and enhance the transmission and understanding of the Dharma.
\q
\b
\v 49 In every community may there be more and more great scholars and practitioners,
\q1 Who avoid entirely all unethical and mistaken forms of livelihood,
\q1 And devote their time to study and reflection, teaching and meditation,
\q1 So that the whole world is enhanced and made beautiful to behold!
\q
\b
\v 50 Through the power of this, may I swiftly traverse all the paths and stages
\q1 Of the complete approach combining sutra and mantra,
\q1 To reach the level of an omniscient buddha spontaneously benefitting myself and others,
\q1 And may I continue to fulfil the wishes of beings for as long as space exists!

\s The Sūtra of the Heart of Transcendent Wisdom
\q
\b
\v 82 Beyond words, beyond thought, beyond description, Prajñāpāramitā
\q1 Unborn, unceasing, the very essence of space
\q1 Yet it can be experienced as the wisdom of our own rigpa:
\q1 Homage to the mother of the buddhas of past, present and future!
\b
\q1 In the language of India: Bhagavatī prajñāpāramitā hṛdaya
\b
\q1 In the language of Tibet:Chomden dema sherab kyi parol tu chinpé nyingpo
\b
\q1 Thus have I heard: At one time the Blessed One was dwelling in Rājgṛha at Vulture Peak mountain, together with a great community of monks and a great community of bodhisattvas.
\b
\q1 At that time, the Blessed One entered an absorption on categories of phenomena called ‘perception of the profound’.
\b
\q1 At the same time, noble Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva and great being, beheld the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom, And saw that the five aggregates are empty of nature.
\q
\b
\v 83 Then, through the Buddha's power, Venerable Śāriputra said to noble Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva and great being:
\b
\q1 “How should a child of noble family who wishes to practise the profound perfection of wisdom train?”
\q
\b
\v 84 This is what he said, and the noble Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva and great being, replied to venerable Śāriputra as follows:
\q
\b
\v 85 “O Śāriputra, a son of noble family or daughter of noble family who wishes to practise the profound perfection of wisdom should regard things in this way: They should see the five aggregates to be empty of nature.
\b
\q1 Form is empty; emptiness is form;
\b
\q1 Emptiness is not other than form; Form is not other than emptiness.
\b
\q1 In the same way, sensation, recognition, Conditioning factors and consciousness are emptiness.
\b
\q1 Therefore, Śāriputra, all dharmas are emptiness. They are without characteristics; they are unarisen and 
\b
\q1 unceasing; They are not tainted and not untainted; They are not deficient and not complete.
\q
\b
\v 86 Therefore, Śāriputra, in emptiness, there is no form, No sensation, no recognition, no conditioning factors, no consciousness; No eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; No visible form, no sound, no odour, no taste, no texture, and no mental objects; There is no eye element up to no mind element; And as far as no mental consciousness element;
\q
\b
\87 There is no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance up to no old age and death, No extinction of old age and death; No suffering, no origin, No cessation, no path, no wisdom, no attainment, And no non-attainment.
\b
\q1 Therefore, Śāriputra, since bodhisattvas have no attainment,
\q
\b
\v 88 They rely on and abide by the perfection of wisdom. Since their minds are unobscured, they have no fear. They completely transcend error and reach the ultimate nirvāṇa.
\q
\b
\v 89 All the buddhas throughout the three times Fully awaken to unsurpassable, true, complete enlightenment by means of the perfection of wisdom.
\q
\b
\v 90 Therefore, the mantra of the perfection of wisdom— The mantra of great insight, the unsurpassed mantra, The mantra that equals the unequalled, the mantra that pacifies all suffering— Is not false and should be understood as true. The mantra of the perfection of wisdom is proclaimed as follows:
\q
\b
\v 91 tadyathā | oṃ gate gate pāragate | pārasaṃgate | bodhi svāhā
\q
\b
\v 92 Śāriputra, a bodhisattva and great being should train in the profound perfection of wisdom in this way.”
\q
\b
\v 93 Thereupon, the Blessed One arose from that absorption And commended Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva and great being: “Excellent, excellent, O son of noble family, that is how it is. That is just how it is.
\q
\b
\v 94 That is just how it is. One should practise the profound perfection of wisdom just as you have taught And then even the tathāgatas will rejoice.”
\q
\b
v\ 95 When the Blessed One had said this, Venerable Śāriputra, and Noble Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva and great being, Together with the whole assembly and the world of gods, human beings, Asuras and gandharvas rejoiced and praised The speech of the Blessed One.
\q
\b
v\ 96 tadyathā | oṃ gate gate pāragate | pārasaṃgate | bodhi svāhā
\q
\b
v\97 Everything that arises interdependently
\q1 Is unceasing and unborn,
\q1 Neither non-existent nor everlasting,
\q1 Neither coming nor going,
\q
\b
v\ 98 Neither multiple nor single.
\q1 To this teaching that pacifies all concepts and duality,
\q1 The most sacred speech of the fully enlightened Buddha,
\q1 We pay homage!
\q
\b
\s The King of Aspiration Prayers: Samantabhadra’s “Aspiration to Good Actions” (Zangchö Mönlam)
\q
\b
\mr Homage to Mañjuśrī, the youthful!
\q
\b
v\ 99 To all the buddhas, the lions of the human race,
\q1 In all directions of the universe, through past and present and future:
\q1 To every single one of you, I bow in homage;
\q1 Devotion fills my body, speech and mind.
\q
\b
v\ 100 Through the power of this prayer, aspiring to Good Action,
\q1 All the victorious ones appear, vivid here before my mind
\q1 And I multiply my body as many times as atoms in the universe,
\q1 Each one bowing in prostration to all the buddhas.
\q
\b
v\ 101 In every atom preside as many buddhas as there are atoms,
\q1 And around them, all their bodhisattva heirs:
\q1 And so I imagine them filling
\q1 Completely the entire space of reality.
\q
\b
v\ 102 Saluting them with an endless ocean of praise,
\q1 With the sounds of an ocean of different melodies
\q1 I sing of the buddhas’ noble qualities,
\q1 And praise all those who have gone to perfect bliss.
\q
\b
v\ 103 To every buddha, I make offerings:
\q1 Of the loveliest flowers, of beautiful garlands,
\q1 Of music and perfumed ointments, the best of parasols,
\q1 The brightest lamps and finest incense.
\q
\b
v\ 104 To every buddha, I make offerings:
\q1 Exquisite garments and the most fragrant scents,
\q1 Powdered incense, heaped as high as Mount Meru,
\q1 Arranged in perfect symmetry.
\q
\b
v\ 105 Then the vast and unsurpassable offerings—
\q1 Inspired by my devotion to all the buddhas, and
\q1 Moved by the power of my faith in Good Actions—
\q1 I prostrate and offer to all you victorious ones.
\q
\b
v\ 106 Whatever negative acts I have committed,
\q1 While driven by desire, hatred and ignorance,
\q1 With my body, my speech and also with my mind,
\q1 Before you, I confess and purify each and every one.
\q
\b
v\ 107 With a heart full of delight, I rejoice at all the merits
\q1 Of buddhas and bodhisattvas,
\q1 Pratyekabuddhas, those in training and the arhats beyond training,
\q1 And every living being, throughout the entire universe.
\q
\b
v\ 108 You who are like beacons of light shining through the worlds,
\q1 Who passed through the stages of enlightenment, to attain buddhahood, freedom from all attachment,
\q1 I exhort you: all of you protectors,
\q1 Turn the unsurpassable wheel of Dharma.
\q
\b
v\ 109 Joining my palms together, I pray
\q1 To you who intend to pass into nirvāṇa,
\q1 Remain, for aeons as many as the atoms in this world,
\q1 And bring well-being and happiness to all living beings.

v\ 110 What little virtue I have gathered through my homage,
\q1 Through offering, confession, and rejoicing,
\q1 Through exhortation and prayer—all of it
\q1 I dedicate to the enlightenment of all beings!
\q
\b
v\ 111 Let offerings be made to buddhas of the past,
\q1 And all who now dwell throughout the ten directions of this universe!
\q1 Let all who are yet to come swiftly fulfil their wishes
\q1 And attain the stages of enlightenment and buddhahood!
\q
\b
v\ 112 Let as many worlds as there are in all the ten directions
\q1 Transform into realms that are vast and utterly pure,
\q1 Filled with buddhas who have sat before the mighty bodhi tree,
\q1 Around them all their bodhisattva sons and daughters!
\q
\b
v\ 113 Let as many sentient beings as there are in all the ten directions
\q1 Live always and forever in happiness and health!
\q1 Let all beings meet the Dharma
\q1 That befits them best! And so may all they hope for be fulfilled!
\q
\b
v\ 114 As I practise the training for enlightenment,
\q1 May I recall all my previous births,
\q1 And in my successive lives, through death and through rebirth,
\q1 May I always renounce the worldly life!
\q
\b
v\ 115 Training in the footsteps of all the victorious buddhas,
\q1 May I bring Good Actions to perfection,
\q1 And my moral conduct be taintless and pure,
\q1 Never lapsing, and always free from fault!
\q
\b
v\ 116 In the language of the gods, nāgas, and yakṣas,
\q1 In the language of demons and of humans too,
\q1 In however many kinds of speech there may be—
\q1 I shall proclaim the Dharma in the language of all!
\q
\b
v\ 117 Taming my mind, and striving in the pāramitās,
\q1 I will never forget the bodhicitta;
\q1 May all my harmful actions and the obscurations they cause
\q1 Be completely purified, every single one!
\q
\b
v\ 118 May I be freed from karma, harmful emotions, and the work of negativity,
\q1 And act for all beings in the world,
\q1 Just like the lotus flower to which mud and water cannot cling,
\q1 Or sun and moon that course unhindered through the sky.
\q
\b
v\ 119 Throughout the reach and range of the entire universe
\q1 I shall pacify completely the suffering of all the lower realms,
\q1 I shall lead all beings to happiness,
\q1 And work for the ultimate benefit of each and every one!
\q
\b
v\ 120 I shall bring enlightened action to perfection,
\q1 Serve beings so as to suit their needs,
\q1 Teach them to accomplish Good Actions,
\q1 And continue this, throughout all the aeons to come!
\q
\b
v\ 121 May I always meet and be accompanied by
\q1 Those whose actions accord with mine;
\q1 And in body, speech and mind as well,
\q1 May our actions and aspirations always be one!
\q
\b
v\ 122 May I always meet spiritual friends
\q1 Who long to be of true help to me,
\q1 And who teach me the Good Actions;
\q1 Never will I disappoint them!
\q
\b
v\ 123 May I always behold the buddhas, here before my eyes,
\q1 And around them all their bodhisattva sons and daughters.
\q1 Without ever tiring, throughout all the aeons to come,
\q1 May the offerings I make them be endless and vast!
\q
\b
v\ 124 May I maintain the sacred teachings of the buddhas,
\q1 And cause enlightened action to appear;
\q1 May I train to perfection in Good Actions,
\q1 And practise these in every age to come!
\q
\b
v\ 125 As I wander through all states of samsaric existence,
\q1 May I gather inexhaustible merit and wisdom,
\q1 And so become an inexhaustible treasury of noble qualities—
\q1 Of skill and discernment, samādhi and liberation!
\q
\b
v\ 126 In a single atom may I see as many pure realms as atoms in the universe:
\q1 And in each realm, buddhas beyond all imagining,
\q1 Encircled by all their bodhisattva heirs.
\q1 Along with them, may I perform the actions of enlightenment!
\q
\b
v\ 127 And so, in each direction, everywhere,
\q1 Even on the tip of a hair, may I see an ocean of buddhas—
\q1 All to come in past, present and future—in an ocean of pure realms,
\q1 And throughout an ocean of aeons, may I enter into enlightened action in each and every one!
\q
\b
v\ 128 Each single word of a buddha’s speech, that voice with its ocean of qualities,
\q1 Bears all the purity of the speech of all the buddhas,
\q1 Sounds that harmonize with the minds of all living beings:
\q1 May I always be engaged with the speech of the buddhas!
\q
\b
v\ 129 With all the power of my mind, may I hear and realize
\q1 The inexhaustible melody of the teachings spoken by
\q1 All the buddhas of past, present and future,
\q1 As they turn the wheels of Dharma!
\q
\b
v\ 130 Just as the wisdom of the buddhas penetrates all future aeons,
\q1 So may I too know them, instantly,
\q1 And in each fraction of an instant may I know
\q1 All that will ever be, in past, present and future!
\q
\b
v\ 131 In an instant, may I behold all those who are the lions of the human race—
\q1 The buddhas of past, present and future!
\q1 May I always be engaged in the buddhas’ way of life and action,
\q1 Through the power of liberation, where all is realized as like an illusion!
\q
\b
v\ 132 On a single atom, may I actually bring about
\q1 The entire array of pure realms of past, of present and future;
\q1 And then enter into those pure buddha realms
\q1 In each atom, and in each and every direction.
\q
\b
v\ 133 When those who illuminate the world, still to come,
\q1 Gradually attain buddhahood, turn the Wheel of Dharma,
\q1 And demonstrate the final, profound peace of nirvāṇa:
\q1 May I be always in their presence!
\q
\b
v\ 134 Through the power of swift miracles,
\q1 The power of the vehicle, like a doorway,
\q1 The power of conduct that possesses all virtuous qualities,
\q1 The power of loving kindness, all-pervasive,
\q
\b
v\ 135 The power of merit that is totally virtuous,
\q1 The power of wisdom free from attachment, and
\q1 The powers of knowledge, skilful means and samādhi,
\q1 May I perfectly accomplish the power of enlightenment!
\q
\b
v\ 136 May I purify the power of karma;
\q1 Destroy the power of harmful emotions;
\q1 Render negativity utterly powerless;
\q1 And perfect the power of Good Actions!
\q
\b
v\ 137 I shall purify oceans of realms;
\q1 Liberate oceans of sentient beings;
\q1 Understand oceans of Dharma;
\q1 Realize oceans of wisdom;
\q
\b
v\ 138 Perfect oceans of actions;
\q1 Fulfil oceans of aspirations;
\q1 Serve oceans of buddhas!
\q1 And perform these, without ever growing weary, through oceans of aeons!
\q
\b
v\ 139 All the buddhas throughout the whole of time,
\q1 Attained enlightenment through Good Actions, and
\q1 Their prayers and aspirations for enlightened action:
\q1 May I fulfil them all completely!
\q
\b
v\ 140 The eldest of the sons of all the buddhas
\q1 Is called Samantabhadra: ‘All-good’—
\q1 So that I may act with a skill like his,
\q1 I dedicate fully all these merits!
\q
\b
v\ 141 To purify my body, my speech and my mind as well,
\q1 To purify my actions, and all realms,
\q1 May I be the equal of Samantabhadra
\q1 In his skill in good dedication!
\q
\b
v\ 142 In order to perform the full virtue of Good Actions,
\q1 I shall act according to Mañjuśrī's prayers of aspiration,
\q1 And without ever growing weary, in all the aeons to come,
\q1 I shall perfectly fulfil every one of his aims!
\q
\b
v\ 143 Let my bodhisattva acts be beyond measure!
\q1 Let my enlightened qualities be measureless too!
\q1 Keeping to this immeasurable activity,
\q1 May I accomplish all the miraculous powers of enlightenment!
\q
\b
v\ 144 Sentient beings are as limitless
\q1 As the boundless expanse of space;
\q1 So shall my prayers of aspiration for them
\q1 Be as limitless as their karma and harmful emotions!
\q
\b
v\ 145 Whoever hears this king of dedication prayers,
\q1 And yearns for supreme enlightenment,
\q1 Who even once arouses faith,
\q1 Will gain true merit greater still
\q
\b
v\ 146 Than by offering the victorious buddhas
\q1 Infinite pure realms in every directions, all ornamented with jewels,
\q1 Or offering them all the highest joys of gods and humans
\q1 For as many aeons as there are atoms in those realms.
\q
\b
v\ 147 Whoever truly makes this Aspiration to Good Actions,
\q1 Will never again be born in lower realms;
\q1 They will be free from harmful companions, and
\q1 Soon behold the Buddha of Boundless Light.
\q
\b
v\ 148 They will acquire all kind of benefits, and live in happiness;
\q1 Even in this present life all will go well,
\q1 And before long,
\q1 They will become just like Samantabhadra.
\q
\b
v\ 149 All negative acts—even the five of immediate retribution—
\q1 Whatever they have committed in the grip of ignorance,
\q1 Will soon be completely purified,
\q1 If they recite this Aspiration to Good Actions.
\q
\b
v\ 150 They will possess perfect wisdom, beauty, and excellent signs,
\q1 Be born in a good family, and with a radiant appearance.
\q1 Demons and heretics will never harm them,
\q1 And all three worlds will honour them with offerings.
\q
\b
v\ 151 They will quickly go beneath the bodhi-tree,
\q1 And there, they will sit, to benefit all sentient beings, then
\q1 Awaken into enlightenment, turn the wheel of Dharma,
\q1 And tame Māra with all his hordes.
\q
\b
v\ 152 The full result of keeping, teaching, or reading
\q1 This Prayer of Aspiration to Good Actions
\q1 Is known to the buddhas alone:
\q1 Have no doubt: supreme enlightenment will be yours!
\q
\b
v\ 153 Just as the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī attained omniscience,
\q1 And Samantabhadra too
\q1 All these merits now I dedicate
\q1 To train and follow in their footsteps.
\q
\b
v\ 154 As all the victorious buddhas of past, present and future
\q1 Praise dedication as supreme,
\q1 So now I dedicate all these roots of virtue
\q1 For all beings to perfect Good Actions.
\q
\b
v\ 155 When it is time for me to die,
\q1 Let all that obscures me fade away, so
\q1 I look on Amitābha, there in person,
\q1 And go at once to his pure land of Sukhāvatī.
\q
\b
v\ 156 In that pure land, may I actualize every single one
\q1 Of all these aspirations!
\q1 May I fulfil them, each and every one,
\q1 And bring help to beings for as long as the universe remains!
\q
\b
v\ 157 Born there in a beautiful lotus flower,
\q1 In that excellent and joyous buddha realm,
\q1 May the Buddha Amitābha himself
\q1 Grant me the prophecy foretelling my enlightenment!
\q
\b
v\ 158 Having received the prophecy there,
\q1 With my billions of emanations,
\q1 Sent out through the power of my mind,
\q1 May I bring enormous benefit to sentient beings, in all the ten directions!
\q
\b
v\ 159 Through whatever small virtues I have gained
\q1 By reciting this “Aspiration to Good Actions”,
\q1 May the virtuous wishes of all beings’ prayers and aspirations
\q1 All be instantly accomplished!
\q
\b
v\ 160 Through the true and boundless merit
\q1 Attained by dedicating this “Aspiration to Good Actions”,
\q1 May all those now drowning in the ocean of suffering,
\q1 Reach the supreme realm of Amitābha!
\q
\b
v\ 161 May this King of Aspirations bring about
\q1 The supreme aim and benefit of all infinite sentient beings;
\q1 May they perfect what is described in this holy prayer, uttered by Samantabhadra!
\q1 May the lower realms be entirely emptied!
\b
\s Prayer for the Future of the Dharma
\q
\b
\v 162 To the buddhas: Vipaśyin, Śikhin, Viśvabhū,
\q1 Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, and Kāśyapa,
\q1 And Śākyamuni—Gautama, deity of all deities,

\q1 Riches and elephants and chariots,

\q
\b
\v 166 “Through the offerings I made to the buddhas, pratyekabuddhas,

\q1 May the teachings blaze, long into the future!
\q
\b

\q1 For many millions of aeons,
\q1 Seeking instruction for the sake of enlightenment,
\q1 May the teachings blaze, long into the future!
\q

\v 168 “Through my conduct of discipline,
\q1 And age-long asceticism,

\q1 May the teachings blaze, long into the future!
\q
\b

\q1 May the gift of Dharma thrive and grow!
\q
\b
\v 175 “In the past, with skilful means and wisdom,

\s The Sage's Harmonious Song of Truth, A Prayer for the Flourishing of the Non-Sectarian Teachings of the Buddha
\q
\b
\v 178 Embodiment of the four kāyas, omniscient Lord Buddha ‘Kinsman of the Sun,’
\q1 Amitāyus, Amitābha, supreme and noble Avalokiteśvara,
\q1 Mañjughoṣa, Vajrapāṇi the Lord of Secrets, and Tārā who wears a wrathful frown,
\q1 The victorious buddhas and all their bodhisattva heirs,
\q
\b
\v 179 Seven Great Patriarchs,1 Six Ornaments2 and Two Supreme Ones,3
\q1 Eighty Mahāsiddhas and Sixteen Arhats4—
\q1 All of you who seek only to benefit the teachings and beings,
\q1 All you great beings without exception, turn your attention towards us!
\q
\b
\v 180 The supreme sage Śākyamuni spent countless aeons
\q1 Completing the two accumulations of merit and wisdom,
\q1 To attain perfect wisdom, love and capacity. Through the power of this truth,
\q1 Long may the complete teachings of the Buddha continue to flourish!
\q
\b
\v 181 Khenpo Śāntarakṣita, Guru Padmasambhava and the Dharma King Trisong Deutsen,
\q1 Were the first to open up the land of snowy mountains to the light of Buddha’s teachings.
\q1 Through the power of their aspirations and those of all the translators, paṇḍitas, vidyādharas and disciples,
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 182 In the treasure-palace that is the Buddha’s extensive teachings,
\q1 Lie great treasures of Dharma, the profound class of sādhanas,
\q1 And the Heart-Essence, profound and vast, sparkling with brilliant light.
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 183 Within the vast expanse of primordial purity and the essence of luminosity,
\q1 All the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are perfectly complete—this pinnacle vehicle
\q1 Is the method for reaching the primordial stronghold of Samantabhadra.
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 184 The two major lineages—profound view and vast conduct—
\q1 Are both complete within the treasury of instructions mastered by Atiśa,
\q1 The tradition of practical instructions passed on by Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné.
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 185 The Words of the Buddha gathered in the three scriptural collections were
\q1 Wonderfully arranged into instructions for beings of the three levels of spiritual capacity,
\q1 As the golden rosary of Kadampa teachings, with their four deities and three sets of texts.5
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 186 The jewel treasury of the Kagyü teachings is a source of inspiration and blessings,
\q1 Coming from the translator Marpa, Milarepa Shepé Dorje and the rest,
\q1 A marvellous system of instruction from an unrivalled succession of masters.
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 187 All the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are the radiance of the natural mind,
\q1 And mind itself, free from complexity, is realized as the essence of the dharmakāya.
\q1 This is the great seal, Mahāmudrā, pervading all that appears and exists throughout saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 188 Learned masters who guard the Buddha’s teachings through explanation, debate and composition,
\q1 On the key instructions of hundreds of texts for the outer and inner sciences, sūtra and mantra,
\q1 This is the Sakyapa tradition of the great compassionate teachers from the divine family of Khön.
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 189 The extremely profound and crucial points of the practice of Lamdré—the Path and its Fruit—,
\q1 With its four criteria of validity,6 have been passed on in a whispered aural lineage,
\q1 The tradition of special instructions coming from Virūpa, the powerful lord of yogins.
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 190 Teachings of the victorious Lobzang Drakpa, skilfully combining the profound and the clear,
\q1 By perfectly uniting the profound view of the Middle Way
\q1 And the two-phase approach of the great and secret Vajra vehicle.
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 191 This is the supreme and noble tradition for practising,
\q1 Without mistake, the essence and gradual stages of the path,
\q1 Which incorporates all three piṭakas and all four classes of tantra,
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 192 The combined traditions of Butön and Jonang, the transmission of instruction and realization,
\q1 For the outer, inner and alternative cycles of the Kālacakra Tantra,
\q1 Including unique explanations, not to be found in any other sūtra or tantra.
\q1 Long may these teachings of the Buddha flourish in the Land of Snows!
\q
\b
\v 193 In short, may all the teachings of the Buddha in the Land of Snows
\q1 Flourish long into the future— the ten great pillars of the study lineage,7
\q1 And the chariots of the practice lineage, such as Shijé (‘Pacifying’) and the rest,
\q1 All of them rich with their essential instructions combining sūtra and mantra.
\q
\b
\v 194 May the lives of the masters who uphold these teachings be secure and harmonious!
\q1 May the sangha preserve these teachings through their study, meditation and activity!8
\q1 May the world be filled with faithful individuals intent on following these teachings!
\q1 And long may the non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha continue to flourish!
\q
\b
\v 195 Throughout all the worlds, may war, conflict, famine and evil thoughts or actions
\q1 Be eradicated entirely, so that even their names are no longer heard!
\q1 May the minds of beings be infused with love! May signs of virtue increase throughout the environment and beings!
\q1 And may an ocean of happiness and wellbeing pervade throughout the whole of space!
\q
\b
\v 196 From this moment on, may I follow the complete path of the teachings,
\q1 Arouse the vast motivation of bodhicitta, and exert myself
\q1 In study, reflection and meditation upon the profound view,
\q1 So that I swiftly reach the ground of temporary and ultimate happiness!
\q
\b
\v 197 For the sake of all sentient beings, who are as infinite as space,
\q1 May I engage in the activity of the buddhas and bodhisattvas,
\q1 Without ever feeling discouraged or falling prey to laziness,
\q1 Always remaining joyful, with confidence and enthusiasm!
\q
\b
\v 198 May my body, my possessions and all my merits,
\q1 Contribute towards the happiness of beings—my very own mothers,
\q1 And may whatever sufferings they are forced to undergo,
\q1 All ripen directly upon me!
\q
\b
\v 199 May all who see me, hear my voice, think of me or put their trust in me,
\q1 Experience the most glorious happiness and virtue!
\q1 And may even those who insult, punish, strike or disparage me,
\q1 Gain the good fortune to set out upon the path to awakening!
\q
\b
\v 200 In short, for as long as space endures,
\q1 And for as long as there is suffering among beings,
\q1 May I too remain, to bring them benefit and happiness,
\q1 In all ways, directly and also indirectly!
\b
